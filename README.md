# TerralizationModcore
Github for TerralizationModcore


TerralizationModcore, before actually contained a coremod, nolonger does, today it's serves as a place for config files for the Terralization Modpack on Technic Launcher.


After many years we finally moved to github, and i regret that we didn't earlier. We've been using Technic Solder for a while and using it for version control and i see now that github is waaay supererior than solder. I uploaded the entire solder repo to github were each release as it's own commit, and i also uploaded partly the changelog for the modpack. the last update v2.0.5d i had the chance to do it the github way since the update came out right before i made the github repo. But hopefully next update will be using github.
